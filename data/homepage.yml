  subtitle: "Current Cornell Meng student"
  description: >
    I am an M.Eng student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, with a first degree BSc (Hons) in Physics from The University of Manchester.
     My expertise lies in
    embedded linux and FPGA design, where I have developed a range of projects such as RISCV pipeline processor and motion detection system using Raspberry Pi.
    I'm currently in Professor Christopher Batten's research group working on a design project using Allo, a Python-embedded domain-specific language,
    to develop accelerators mapped to an Alveo U250 FPGA and compared against Intel Xeon CPU performance.

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      I am a versatile engineer with a blend of research and hardware expertise. Transitioning from physics to hardware through self-study, 
      I've mastered Verilog, FPGA design, and embedded systems. This ability to rapidly acquire new skills is reflected in my work, from building 
      embedded Linux systems on Beaglebone Black to investigating the electrical properties of graphene. My broad technical interests, from embedded 
      systems to advanced material research to FPGA, enable me to develop comprehensive solutions.   
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
      Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through hiking and long-distance running, finding balance and inspiration in the mountains. 
      Cooking is another passion of mine, where I love to experiment with Chinese and Korean recipes, exploring flavors and techniques.
      I've traveled to diverse places like the Netherlands and Italy, 
      as well as vibrant cities in Britain such as Edinburgh and London. 
      These experiences continue to fuel my curiosity and deepen my appreciation for discovering new cultures and ideas.
