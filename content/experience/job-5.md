### Investigation of the Electrical Properties of Graphene

In my research on the electrical properties of graphene under the mentorship of Prof. Alexander Grigorenko, I focused on preparing high-quality graphene samples using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). After successfully preparing the samples, I applied the van der Pauw method to measure the sheet resistance and Hall resistance, which provided key insights into the electrical behavior of the material.

One of the primary objectives was to determine the charge carrier density within the graphene at various gate voltages. By modifying the Hall coefficient equations and making reasonable assumptions about the graphene's properties, I was able to accurately calculate the charge carrier density and observe its variations with applied gate voltages. This process required precise control and measurement, contributing to a deeper understanding of how external factors influence the sampleâ€™s electrical properties.

I further explored the effects of different doping conditions on the graphene sample, including undoped, water vapor-doped, and ammonia-doped states. By analyzing the electric properties under these conditions, I discovered phenomena such as zero Hall resistance in specific scenarios, along with extremely low charge carrier mobility. These findings contributed valuable data to the field of graphene research, highlighting its potential for future applications in electronics and material science.
