### Raspberry Pi 4 Motion Detection and Surveillance System 

In this project, I developed a motion detection system using a Raspberry Pi 4, leveraging a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect movement. The system integrates an indicator light to provide immediate feedback when motion is detected, offering a simple yet effective way to monitor activity in real-time.

Additionally, I implemented a photo capture and upload feature using the V2 Pi Camera. Whenever motion is detected, the system automatically captures an image and uploads it to a designated storage location. To enhance user experience, I included an email notification feature that sends an alert with the photo, timestamp, and location details, ensuring that users are promptly informed about any activity.

To further streamline interaction with the system, I designed a user-friendly webpage that allows users to view newly captured photos, access the latest capture details, and modify camera settings. The webpage includes features for both manual and scheduled photo or video captures, giving users full control over the systemâ€™s configuration. This comprehensive design makes it easy for users to monitor their surroundings and customize their preferences remotely.
