### Robot Platform and GPIO Control with Raspberry Pi 

Developed an autonomous robotic system utilizing Raspberry Pi with integrated piTFT display for real-time motor control and feedback. Designed and implemented Python scripts to control DC motors using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), enabling precise motor speed and directional control. Created reusable and modular code for robot control, allowing for easy future integration and system scalability.

Engineered a touch-screen interface to provide live feedback on motor operations, including directional status and motor history. Implemented safety features such as a panic stop button to immediately halt motor activity, ensuring robust operational control. Optimized motor control via both physical buttons and a graphical user interface (GUI), enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

Led the full assembly of the robot, integrating motor controllers, sensors, and power systems, resulting in a self-contained, mobile platform capable of autonomous movement. Developed system automation scripts to launch control applications at boot, ensuring the robot operates independently without external devices.
