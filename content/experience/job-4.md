### Embedded Linux Development on Beaglebone Black 

During my work with the Beaglebone Black, I developed an embedded Linux system, gaining in-depth experience with the entire boot process, from ROM to U-Boot and the Linux kernel. I compiled and tested U-Boot and the Linux kernel, configuring platform devices and adjusting ARM-board configuration files to ensure optimal performance for the target environment.

In addition, I implemented and explored various boot modes such as eMMC, UART, TFTP, and NFS. This work also involved updating the Debian OS on the Beaglebone Black, which required a thorough understanding of the device's bootloader and kernel configuration. The use of multiple boot modes allowed flexibility in how the system could be deployed and updated in different use cases.

I further enhanced my embedded development skills by working with tools such as Busybox and Buildroot to streamline the Linux environment. I customized the boot configuration by writing and testing uEnv.txt files and used I2C tools for hardware interfacing, enabling communication between the Beaglebone and peripheral devices. This project provided comprehensive hands-on experience with embedded Linux development and system customization.
